      <p>
        Hi, My name is Furqan Ahmed Khan, I am an hobby programmer, I can make
        discord bots. I have been programming for about 2 years now. I am
        self-taught and have learned a lot through online resources. I enjoy
        programming because it is a creative outlet for me and I enjoy problem
        solving. I am always looking to improve my skills and learn new
        programming languages.

      <p>
        Hi, my name is Furqan Ahmed Khan and I am a self-taught programmer. I
        have a strong passion for programming and have spent a lot of time
        learning about it on my own. My primary focus has been on creating
        discord bots and Minecraft servers, but I also have some knowledge of
        HTML and CSS. My ultimate goal is to become an AI programmer, and I am
        constantly working towards this goal by learning and practicing as much
        as I can. In my spare time, I enjoy delving into new programming
        challenges and expanding my skillset.
